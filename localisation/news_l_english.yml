splatnews.1.t:0 "The End of Agent Four"
splatnews.1.d:0 "Today marks a grim day in Inkopolis history. Today, the Octarian Empire announced its possession of The Great Zapfish. Around midday, every broadcast worldwide was hijacked by DJ Octavio. In this announcement, he declared that the Octarian Empire was now the dominate power in the world, and that all shall bow before them. To back this statement up, he then showed the captured Great Zapfish, now being used to power Octarian Factories. In addition, he condemned Inkopolis for attempting to “steal what is his by right.”  \n To the end, he then turned the camera around, revealing a captured Inkling, wearing the traditional gear of the Squidbeak Splatoon, his hands tied behind his back as he was lead to a guillotine.  Then, before the entire world, the blade dropped."
