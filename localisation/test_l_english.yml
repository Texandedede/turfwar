INK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Inkopolis is the homeland of the Inklings, the most numerous race on Earth. Here, Inklings have lived in peace for generations, given unlimited power by the great zapfish and watched over by the Squidbeak Splatoon. Recently, the peace has been shattered. The Great Zapfish has been stolen for the second time in the last decade, and the agent from the Squidbeak Splatoon, Agent 4, has failed to recover it. With this, the existence of the sinister Octarian Empire has been revealed. Marie, one half of the Squid Sisters, has been forced to take a leadership role. The peaceful lives of the Inklings have been shattered. Can Inkopolis survive this new age of war?"
OCR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Four years ago, during the first Great Zapfish crisis, the Squid Sisters performed the Calamari Inkantation in the center of the Octarian Empire, breaking the mind control of millions of Octarians who witnessed the event. Based out of the city of Mount Nantai, these Octolings, together with their Inkling cousins, have united for the sole purpose of freeing their species from DJ Octavio's infernal control. Short on equipment, they know its only a matter of time before DJ Octavio comes to reclaim what he views as his property. With war coming fast, Marina Iida has been voted into power. The future of the Octoling race now rests in her hands."
OCT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Octarian Empire has existed as long as Inkopolis, perhaps even longer. Although once peaceful with their inkling cousins, the Octarians of today are led by DJ Octavio, a ruthless dictator who uses his hypnotic beats to rule over the mind of every citizen. Octavio desires only the destruction of Inkopolis, and will stop at nothing to leave the city in ruins. Despite recent victories, the impact of the first Zapfish crisis leaves the Octarian Empire in a dangerous position. Should Octavio's conditioning fail any further, the Octarian Empire is very likely to fall to pieces. Octavio fast prepares for war on the Inklings, to end the threat before it can truly begin."
GRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Grizzco Industries, originally a peacetime organization, adapted its business model upon the discovery of the Salmonid Horde and the eggs which they lay. The normal eggs of Salmonid, known as power eggs, can be refined into raw material that creates better weaponry and equipment then what is normally produced. However, with the Salmonids due to march soon, the brave harvesters of Grizzco have come face to face with the reality of the resurgent Salmonids. Underfunded and understaffed, the worlds first line prepares for the horde. As discontent stirs in the ranks, can Grizzco hold back the never ending march of the Salmon?"
JFC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Jelly Free Cities, established originally indepdendently from Inkopolis, is the most concentrated point of Jellyfish in the world. Renowned the world over as the home of scholars and engineers, Jellyfish make most of their society function by salvaging the old world. \nHowever, recently, an odd book, known only as the Manifesto, an ancient writing, has spread through the city. Within, the issues of a society based around money is outlined, and calls for violent revolution against such a society. The embers of revolution burn, and threaten to become an all consuming fire once more."
TAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Sanitized Lands were once an collection of agrarian Octoling and Inkling societies. Within this land they lived peaceful lives for generations, until the mad AI Tartar woke up. Despite his original prime directive to spread humanities knowledge to the next life-form, he was disgusted by the lifeforms he saw. After months of calculating, he came to the conclusion that they must all be exterminated, and blended into a new, more perfect life-form. With this decision, Tartar began by conquering the Sanitized Lands, creating millions of sanitized lifeforms that answer only to him. He looks now at the rest of the world. It is unclean, and must be purged."
IDL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the world falls into chaos, lands that were once sovereign territory of Inkopolis have fallen into complete anarchy. Within these lands there exist several factions, all vying for control. The Octolings, lead by the hypnotized Squid Sister, Callie, seek to bring the front line closer to Inkopolis. The Communists, lead by a council of Jellyfish, aim to control the land as a means to begin their revolution. And finally, Inkopolis's forces, lead by Captain Craig Cuttlefish, seek to regain control over the area. Its anyone's game.. and perhaps out of the chaos, something entirely new may be born."
SAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Salmonid Hordes are more of a force of nature then a nation proper. Having appeared shortly after the first Inkling and Octarian societies, these hostile creatures are controlled by a hive mind, and want nothing more then to breed and expand, so that they may have more room to breed. Working in cycles, the Salmonids begin to expand every ten years. Ten years ago, their advance was stopped by the intervention of the corporation that would become Grizzco. Ten years have passed since that day, and the Salmonid Hordes have reorganized and are ready to expand. The march of the pinkfish will not be stopped, and the world will tremble in their wake."
