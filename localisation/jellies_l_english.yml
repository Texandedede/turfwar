jfc.1.t:0 "Time's Scar"
jfc.1.d:0 "Despite our recent issues, scavenging has continued. Recently, we uncovered a hidden treasure trove of goodies. One of our scavenging boats pulled out a footlocker, belonging to what appeared to be an ancient human soldier. Within was a long wooden stick with some very hard metal at the end, a long since faded photograph, and several strange pieces of rolled cloth, containing some kind of poison within them. However, one item seemed harder to open then the others, a diary locked tight with a key. Every time we tried to pick the lock gently, it almost seemed to change shape, as if trying to prevent us from gaining access. After months of trying, we have finally broken through this lock. Although most of the book is lost to time, the text too weathered to read, within there is a single thing we can understand. A flag, drawn, colored, and preserved in remarkable detail. This Flag..."
